# survey-report-scrapr
📄 ⛏ **Break data out of PDF prison**

This [walkthrough](survey-report-scrapr.md) demonstrates how to: 
* scrape data from PDF tables using `tabulizer`
* manage unwieldy header types and tidy scraped data output using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `stringr`
* abstract steps into a scraper function
* iterate across multiple tables and PDFs with `purrr`
